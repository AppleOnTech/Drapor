# Drapor

Drapor is a two-column theme for micro.blog sites using the [Dracula Theme colors](https://draculatheme.com) based on [Vapor1994](https://github.com/aezell/vapor1994) by Alex Ezell

# Warning
Be sure to look through all the layouts, there is stuff for monitization that is good for me, but will you no good. When I have time I will point out where it is specifically.
